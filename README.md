## 1. Introduction.
<img src="cassandra.png" height="200"> 
Apache Cassandra is a free and open-source, distributed, wide column store, NoSQL database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. Cassandra offers robust support for clusters spanning multiple datacenters, with asynchronous masterless replication allowing low latency operations for all clients.

Avinash Lakshman, one of the authors of Amazon's Dynamo, and Prashant Malik initially developed Cassandra at Facebook to power the Facebook inbox search feature. Facebook released Cassandra as an open-source project on Google code in July 2008. In March 2009 it became an Apache Incubator project. On February 17, 2010 it graduated to a top-level project.

Apache Incubator is the gateway for open-source projects intended to become fully fledged Apache Software Foundation projects.
The Incubator project was created in October 2002 to provide an entry path to the Apache Software Foundation for projects and codebases wishing to become part of the Foundation's efforts. All code donations from external organizations and existing external projects wishing to move to Apache must enter through the Incubator.

The Apache Incubator project serves on the one hand as a temporary container project until the incubating project is accepted and becomes a top-level project of the Apache Software Foundation or becomes subproject of a proper project such as the Jakarta Project or Apache XML. On the other hand, the Incubator project documents how the Foundation works, and how to get things done within its framework. This means documenting process, roles and policies within the Apache Software Foundation and its member projects.

Facebook developers named their database after the Trojan mythological prophet Cassandra, with classical allusions to a curse on an oracle.
